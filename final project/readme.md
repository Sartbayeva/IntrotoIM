For my Final Project, I am probably going to create a game similar to Doodle Jump. I used to play this game a lot when I was younger, and so I would like to add some new elements to it and recreate this game. 

My character will keep jumping higher and higher while earning points. Also, there will be different special objects as the doodle player gets higher. The special objects will include things related to NYUAD.

I will use 4 switches/buttons to control my characterâ€™s moving up, down, left and right. Also, I am thinking about including a photoresistor to catch those special objects.

Arduino will determine one of the buttons is pressed and send the input to Processing, while Processing will take the input from the buttons and use it to move the doodle character to the left, right, top or bottom, and from the photoresistor to catch the objects.
