# Arduino UNO Assignment 1: create light pattern/reaction 

For this weekly assignment, I decided to make a very simple puzzle consisting of 4 momentary switches and 4 LED lights: yellow, red, green, blue.
The *schematic* for the circuit is as follows:

The *breadbord* is as follows:

## Challenges
For a long time, my program was not giving the right output. Especially, I had a problem with blue LED. I changed my led and button/switch many times. But anyway it was not turn on. Then when I looked at my code and read thoroughly it turned out that in pinMode I wrote the wrong number. 

### So, if you ran into a problem, CHECK YOUR PIN NUMBER BEFORE REPLACING YOUR LEDS, BUTTONS AND WIRES!!!

## Results
I created 2 different light patterns/puzzles.

The *first* one:

The *second* one:

## New vocabulary in Arduino program
1. digitalWrite
2. Serial.begin
3. pinMode
4. INPUT
5. OUTPUT
6. HIGH
7. LOW

## Overall, it was fun and interesting!
