### Arduino Assignment 1: create light pattern

For this weekly assignment, I decided to make a puzzle consisting of 4 switches and 4 LED lights: yellow, red, green, blue.
The schematic for the circuit is as follows:

The breadbord is as follows:

## Challenges
For a long time, my program was not giving the right output. Especially, I had a problem with blue LED. I changed my led and button/switch many times. But anyway it was not turn on. Then when I looked at my code and read thoroughly it turned out that in pinMode I wrote the wrong number. So, ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PIN NUMBER BEFORE REPLACING YOUR LEDS, BUTTONS AND WIRES!!!!

## Results
I created 2 different light patterns/puzzles. https://github.com/Sartbayeva/IntrotoIM/blob/main/March%2023/first_light%20pattern.gif)

The first one:

## It was very fun and interesting!
